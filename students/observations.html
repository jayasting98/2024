It provides easy integration with oAuth providers such as GitHub, Facebook, O365 and serves as an easy way for enterprises to set up multi-tenancy identity providers with clear separation of identities. Zitadel is written in Go and consists of an interesting mix of server-side rendered authentication (using Go and HTML templates), along with a client side application written in Angular, as well as modularised Core library that uses Event-driven architecture to ensure that all events are not only captured but also traceable.</p> <p>The team favours transaction safety, with high availability, and have employed and implemented it&#39;s own message queue system. It works by placing events into an in-memory queue for subscribers, under the pub-sub model.</p> <p>Zitadel has 7.1k stars and is used by many organisations as an alternative to other identity infrastructure platforms, due to it&#39;s heavy customisability in terms of branding and deployment options.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-3">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ul><li>Fixed button positioning issues on email verification screen within the Login page <a href="https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/7579">PR #7579</a></li> <li>Fixed navigation issues where users would be directed incorrectly to another page when clicking on &quot;Back&quot; <a href="https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/7683">PR #7683</a></li></ul> <h3 id="my-learning-record-3">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Deploying both an Angular console application, which is a management interface, as well as Server side pages for authentication (Login, Register and Password Reset pages) were important. Particularly, Zitadel uses HTML templates heavily along with a flexible component system that enables easy internationalisation, which is important for a tool like Zitadel that everyone can use.</p> <p>Also, learning about gRPC through interactions with the backend was also enlightening as I was more familiar with GraphQL and traditional HTTP endpoints through my experience with CATcher/WATcher and personal projects and internships.</p> <p>gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) by default, which is a lightweight, highly efficient serialization tool; which serves it&#39;s purpose when building a distributed application like Zitadel. It also allows for server-side and client-side streaming, both of which are used (particularly for event logging) in Zitadel.</p> <h3 id="project-templ">Project: Templ<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-templ" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Templ is a HTML templating language for Go that has great developer tooling, including an LSP (Language Server Protocol) for Vim users and extension for VSCode users. With Templ, we can create components that render fragments of HTML and then compose them to create screens, pages, documents or apps.</p> <p>This allows for</p> <ul><li>Server-side rendering (deployed as a serverless function or standard Go program)</li> <li>Static rendering (create static HTML files to deploy how you choose)</li> <li>Compiled code (components compiled to performant Go code)</li> <li>Ability to move away from JavaScript in client-side and server-side contexts</li></ul> <p>Templ borrows heavily from the Component model in React and Angular, and as such models it&#39;s own components as mark up and code that is compiled into functions that return a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">templ.Component</code> interface.</p> <p>This allows for Templ to be used in tandem with htmx, to selectively replace content within a webpage instead of replacing the whole web page within the browser.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-4">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ul><li>Add documentation for using Templ with i18n by using <a href="https://github.com/invopop/ctxi18n">ctxi18n</a>: <a href="https://github.com/a-h/templ/pull/666">PR #666</a></li></ul> <h3 id="my-learning-record-4">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>I learnt how to build an SSR application using Go, HTMX and Templ by building an example application to provide documentation for i18n support. I also used Server-side Events which enabled minified HTMX runtime to add elements based on the component that was received on the stream endpoint. I also understood how i18n was generally implemented on products with a need to support a variety of languages, as well as building generalised components that decoupled the actual components from the textual UI.</p> <h3 id="project-ferretdb">Project: FerretDB<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-ferretdb" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>FerretDB was founded to become the de-facto open-source substitute to MongoDB. FerretDB is an open-source proxy, converting the MongoDB 5.0+ wire protocol queries to SQL - using PostgreSQL or SQLite as a database engine.</p> <p>MongoDB was originally the eye-opening technology for developers that allowed developers to build applications faster than using relational databases. However, with MongoDB abandoning its open-source roots, there was a need for an easy-to-use open-source document database solution, which is what FerretDB aims to fill.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-5">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ul><li>Add local changelog generation that uses a milestone title to generate the batch of changes for the milestone <a href="https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/pull/4219">PR #4219</a></li></ul> <h3 id="my-learning-record-5">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>While I did not learn much about the database design in itself, I learnt about Conventional Commits: a standardised format that dictates how developers should write their commit messages. Conventional commits allowed for projects with a large developer base to have visibility and transparency over who did what, when. Furthermore, the standardisation allows for easy automatic changelog generation, important for when products are shipped out to actual users; as well as making it easier for people to contribute to projects.</p> <p>FerretDB suffered from the lack of implementation of Conventional Commits: without it, it was dependent on the platform (GitHub) the repository was hosted on to actually generate meaningful Changelogs. This added additional dependencies that tied the project with GitHub unnecessarily, instead of allowing the project to be independent of the Git versioning platform it was hosted on (GitLab, BitBucket are suitable alternatives).</p> <p>As such, Changelog generation was originally done by using the GitHub workflow directly, which overly complicated the release process, necessitating for another way to locally generate the Changelog.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="wong-chee-hong">WONG CHEE HONG<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#wong-chee-hong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-sourceacademy-frontend">Project: SourceAcademy Frontend<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-sourceacademy-frontend" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Sourceacademy is the an online experiential environment used for teaching students computational thinking and is used by the School of Computing in NUS and Uppsala University in Sweden to teach introductory programming modules. The frontend is built using React and Redux.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-6">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-6" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>In this project, I have authored and merged two PRs. They are listed as follows:</p> <ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2943">Fix double window prompt when uploading users #2943</a></p> <p>In this PR, I fixed a long standing bug regarding the UI where two file prompts show up upon clicking a &quot;upload csv&quot; button. To solve this, I first reproduced the issue on my local development environment, and then identified the issue, which happened to be the incorrect use of a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">&lt;FileInput&gt;</code> react component within a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">&lt;CSVReader&gt;</code> component. The components were imported from a <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">theming library</a> and a <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">CSV parser library</a> respectively.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2946">i18n framework #2946</a></p> <p>In this PR, I laid the groundwork for future internationalization work to be done on SourceAcademy. SourceAcademy started out as a project in NUS but has plans to go international, as seen by its use in Uppsala university in Sweden. As such, adding i18n to the project will be crucial for its future.</p> <p>In this PR, I introduced the use of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">react-i18next</code> library, as well as define data structures to allow future translators to easily add on new translations and languages.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="my-learning-record-6">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-6" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><strong>React &amp; Redux</strong></p> <p>Sourceacademy is built in React and Redux, and as such, I have had to learn how to work with these two libraries. While I have used React and Redux before, I have not seen how it can be used in a large scale project like Sourceacademy. In Sourceacademy, I have seen how Redux and Redux Toolkit was used to create a typesafe global state that is shared across the entire application and I appreciate how well structured the code was in the repository.</p> <p><strong>i18next</strong></p> <p>i18next is a library that allows for internationalization in a React project. It is a powerful library that allows for easy translation of text in a project. During my implementation of the i18n framework in Sourceacademy, I referenced several implementations of i18n across various established open source repos such as HospitalRun and FreeCodeCamp for any best practices. From these references, I learned how to structure the i18n files and the various translation resources to make it easy for future translators to add on new translations.</p> <p>Furthermore, the i18n framework that I contributed to has strong type safety and only allows keys that are defined in the translation files to be used, making it easier for future developers to see what keys are allowed on what file. I am grateful for the Sourceacademy maintainers for their guidance in this implementation.</p> <p><strong>Practices and tools from SourceAcademy that could be adopted by CATcher</strong></p> <p>SourceAcademy utilises Yarn as their package manager. From almost all points of view, yarn has the exact same functionality as npm, but it is faster and more reliable. As such, we could consider moving over to using Yarn in CATcher as well.</p> <p>Furthermore, I was particularly impressed with the testing framework that they had to ensure any new changes were not breaking. They made use of jest and had an interactive UI test runner that allowed the developer to see which tests were failing and why. This is something that CATcher could consider adopting as well.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <h1 id="markbind">MarkBind<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#markbind" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h1> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="chan-yu-cheng">CHAN YU CHENG<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#chan-yu-cheng" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-foo-2">Project: Foo<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-foo-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-7">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-7" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-7">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-7" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

Upon investigating the issue on the frontend, I discovered that the existing regex was only configured to support company URLs. To resolve this, I updated the regex to also accommodate school URLs and conducted tests to ensure the fix was effective.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-8">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-8" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h3 id="gomock">gomock<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#gomock" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>I have learned to use GoMock, a mocking framework for Golang, which streamlines the creation of mock objects for unit testing. It helps with decoupling components, enabling the simulation of complex behaviors and interactions. I am surprised how easy it to use to mock complex behaviours.
Will definitely use it for Golang testing next time!</p> <h4 id="resource-used">Resource used:<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#resource-used" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/uber-go/mock">gomock docs</a></li></ul> <h3 id="yarn-workspaces">Yarn workspaces<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#yarn-workspaces" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Yarn Workspaces is a feature of Yarn that simplifies handling multiple packages within a single repository by enabling shared dependencies and centralized script management. I learnt Yarn Workspaces while setting up the repository for the Twenty project.
Overall, it is a good experience as I learnt more alternatives to Lerna and NPM workspaces.</p> <h4 id="resource-used-2">Resource used:<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#resource-used-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces">Yarn workspaces docs</a></li></ul> <h3 id="practices-tools-from-mattermost-that-could-be-adopted-by-markbind">Practices/tools from Mattermost that could be adopted by Markbind<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#practices-tools-from-mattermost-that-could-be-adopted-by-markbind" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>I was particularly impressed with the <a href="https://docs.twenty.com/start/local-setup/">Twenty&#39;s onboarding guide</a> because it includes multi-OS setup guides and instructions on setting up through Docker containers. Furthermore, it provides an IDE setup guide, and its repository contains a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">.vscode/extensions.json</code> file that assists users in configuring VS Code. For Markbind, while the Docker container setup may not be necessary, adopting a multi-OS guide could be beneficial. It could promote useful tools like <code class="hljs inline no-lang">nvm</code> for testing across multiple Node.js versions, and a VS Code extensions list could help new developers adhere to our coding practices.</p> <p>I was really impressed with the PR review workflow at Mattermost. It&#39;s incredibly systematic, featuring stages such as UI review, Dev review, and QA review, which make the process feel seamless. Additionally, they utilize bots to remind reviewers to complete their reviews. While Markbind is smaller and might not require such an elaborate setup, investigating the potential of GitHub PR bots could be beneficial. These tools could streamline our review process and ensure that contributions are efficiently and effectively vetted.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="hannah-chia-kai-xin">HANNAH CHIA KAI XIN<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#hannah-chia-kai-xin" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-godot">Project: Godot<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-godot" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>While I was not able to make a contribution to the main repository, as I was using this software and following development discussions I&#39;d like to share my understanding.

Nevertheless, it seems that while there is an active developer community there is also an abundance of work and limits on attention. Furthermore, with such a big project and so many issues, this is a project that uses an organisation to group many active repositories - the main godot repository, as well as godot-docs and <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues?page=2&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen">godot-proposals</a> are some examples. godot-proposals are used for new feature requests and has 4.2k issues as well as discussions! <code class="hljs inline no-lang">godot</code> has over 5k issues - and over 2.4k PULL REQUESTS. This is an huge volume especially considering that it is an active repository - pull requests are closed or merged daily.</p> <p><strong>Decision Making</strong>: Godot mantainers discuss new features over PR meetings that happen on a regular basis before asking community members to work on them. Given the volume of requests and the number of users using the program, adding new features depends on certain principles. There has been some discussion over this issue that was very interesting: <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/575"> Godot Engine&#39;s vision and development philosophy should be better formalized or easily accessible #575 </a></p> <p>(This user was later was banned from the organisation and <a href="https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/no_longer_a_blue_robot.html">wrote a book about the experience</a>)</p> <p>Leaving aside the drama, the point around &quot;What direction does an open source repository go&quot; was very intersting to investigate, though I haven&#39;t yet come to any conclusion. <mark>This is the source of one of my suggestions to the CS3282 team to document some of the design principles in MarkBind such as extensibility, so as to aid in new batches making decisions about the project</mark>. Right now, a lot of this knowledge only lives in a few people (like prof Damith).

To compensate for this, the discord server where development takes place is very active, and new developers are encouraged to hop over and ask questions. One advantage I noticed form having a very light set of documentation is you feel empowered to start pretty fast, as you aren&#39;t worried that you&#39;ve missed something that isn&#39;t written down. However, this also does restrict some communication to a more closed platform, and knowledge about the architecture and why certain decisions are made is totally opaque unless someone calls it out explicitly. Furthermore, code comments/discussion may also occur primarily in Discord.</p> <p>An active, up to date issue tracker is mantained by the main developer, which uses a simple format of &quot;Motivation&quot; and &quot;Goal&quot; and also uses the GitHub project tracker to manage all issues. One thing I really liked about the issue tracker is that it mainly uses only two criteria - priority and size - but this is very effective as a contributor to understand what is worth working on. XS PRs only involve a small amount of code, and the are good PRs to try in multiple categories. The quick response from developers was very motivating when exploring this project.</p> <p>One nice aspect of the project is it is dogfooded by the creator and there&#39;s fairly close communication with a passionate community, so there is a clear motivation for features which are asked for and developments made. This is aided by a very clear value proposition to Honkai: Star Rail players.</p> <h3 id="react-admin">React-Admin<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#react-admin" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>React-Admin is a tool to build CRUD apps for business usecases very quickly.

It was extremely useful to me, which is a good example of how open source can help people you don&#39;t know anything about.</p> <p>While documentation was relatively sparse, one advantage of the way the user developed it was by creating demos using the system and making those code repos public - though the web based demos went down, the code was still up on Godot and very helpful to figure out syntax.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-9">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-9" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/9094">Add new documentation about the pre-commit hook #9094</a> - PR Merged</li></ul> <p>After the precommit hook was added in the godot repository, there had to be documentation added for it. I took this up because it seemed to me to be something that would affect a lotof new developers, but even though I had 3-4 reviews, it took around a month to merge, which discouraged me from trying to merge something to the Godot repository. This PR also demonstrates the rate of change and development in Godot - after the commit hook improvement was made, only a few weeks later the decision was made to change one of the linting tools - which would also modify the documentation I had written as the precommit hook helped to lint using that tool.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/fribbels/hsr-optimizer/pull/282">feat(#278): add button to ScoringModal to reset all characters</a> - PR merged</li></ul> <p>This PR modified the UI to meet user demand.

When #35 is implemented, scores will eventually be attached to scoring profiles instead of characters. The build itself should be saved with a profile attached to it instead of the behaviour we have now in the fix)</p> <p>One obvious issue with mantaining build&#39;s score based on the scoring algorithm when it was saved is the user will probably forget what their custom settings were, and it&#39;d be a whole bunch more (out of scope) work to make a UI that makes sense for this.</p> <p>so the fix for this bug is just to get the two numbers to match by updating the saved builds since &quot;we want to score both the character and its saved builds by the current user defined scoring algorithm&quot;.</p></blockquote> <p>This feature was interesting to me because of how it interfaced with the game itself. Because there are multiple ways to develop a character, players might want to score / optimise their character to different stats. This was an interesting mid-point solution working towards a bigger solution in the future (multiple saved builds)</p> <p>It was also interesting how data was separated. Originally I wrote this PR to call a function from the data class (separation of concerns) but as the data class is in .js and not .ts (slow migration) and the feature is relatively isolated, they suggested I put it all into one file where it was called instead.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="lee-wei-david">LEE WEI, DAVID<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#lee-wei-david" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-foo-3">Project: Foo<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-foo-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-10">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-10" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-9">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-9" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

He agreed to provide weekly reviews to facilitate my contributions and we set up a communication channel on Discord.</p> <p>He suggested that I work on the documentation website, <a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org">date-fns.org</a> as the docs did not support displaying function aliases yet. I then added aliases to functions in the TypeDoc documentation website in <a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org/pull/216">PR#216</a>.</p> <p><strong>Duration Support</strong></p> <p>Next, as per the project&#39;s current needs shared by the maintainer, I focussed on improving Duration support in date-fns.

I added an ellipse class for annotation box styles in <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/24596">PR#24596</a>. The PR was merged and I learned how to contribute to open-source projects by following the contributing guide. The maintainers were responsive to issues and PRs; however, I sought a project that aligned better with my interests and chosen area of expertise.</p> <p><strong>react-awesome-loaders</strong></p> <p>I also tried contributing to <a href="https://github.com/ashutosh1919/react-awesome-loaders">react-awesome-loaders</a>, a React component library, in Dec 2023. Although the library had amazing loader designs, it used Node 12 and could not be utilized in modern projects using Next.js, which has a minimum Node requirement of Node 18. I successfully updated the node version in the project and used <code class="hljs inline no-lang">ncu</code> or <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm-check-updates</code> to update old dependencies in <a href="https://github.com/ashutosh1919/react-awesome-loaders/pull/24">PR#24</a>. Unfortunately, the documentation site could not be updated as it was created with <a href="https://github.com/gregberge/smooth-doc">smooth-doc</a>, which was not compatible with Node 18. Considering that I needed to migrate the entire documentation site to a new framework, I put the PR on hold and it was not merged.</p> <p><strong>checkstyle</strong></p> <p>Then I tried my hand at <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle">checkstyle</a>, a Java static code analysis tool, in Jan 2024. I removed //ok comments for the equalavoidsnull module in <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/14215">PR#14215</a> and the PR was merged. The project maintainers were responsive and the issues for new contributors were handpicked by maintainers and labelled as &quot;good first issue&quot;, &quot;good second issue&quot;, &quot;good third issue&quot; and &quot;good fourth issue&quot; (1 - 3 each). This facilitated easy identification of issues for new contributors and progression through the contribution process.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-10">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-10" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="1-tools-and-technologies">1. Tools and Technologies<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#1-tools-and-technologies" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>1.1 Learning why date-fns over others</strong></p> <p>Working with a popular npm package, I learned extensively about the library&#39;s perks from the documentation itself. I discovered that date-fns utilizes tree-shaking to reduce the size of the final bundle and read the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">webpack documentation</a> to understand its functionality. Tree shaking involves dead code elimination to ensure production-ready code with minimal file size, allowing compatibility with tools like webpack, Rollup, etc.</p> <p>The project also employs a function-based API where each function is a pure function, enabling better immutability and testability. Moreover, it allows for importing only the necessary functions, enhancing performance. Additionally, the project offers a functional-programming submodule facilitating improved function composition, which allowed revisiting some concepts taught in CS1101S.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Testing npm packages</strong></p> <p>Since I worked on an npm package, I learned various methods to test npm packages locally beyond standard unit testing. Instead of repeatedly publishing the package to npm (which I would have done a year ago -_-), I utilized <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm link</code> to test the package locally in other JavaScript projects. I learned about this approach from <a href="https://urre.me/writings/test-local-npm-packages/">Urban Sanden&#39;s blog</a>. Additionally, I used <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm tsx</code> to get a TypeScript REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and required the respective date-fns function to test them within the terminal. This was facilitated by <a href="https://tsx.is/">tsx</a>, which stands for TypeScript Execute, and enables running TypeScript in Node.js with improved Developer Experience (watch mode, scripts, etc).</p> <p><strong>1.3 Generating documentation</strong></p> <p>date-fns uses TypeDoc to generate documentation for the project. I used <a href="https://typedoc.org/guides/overview/">the official TypeDoc docs</a> to understand its functionality. The documentation site generator created documentation based on the TSDoc comments deployed on Firebase. The TSDoc standard was used for documenting the code, akin to JavaDoc. Having worked with multiple TypeScript projects before, this was my first experience using a TypeScript documentation generator, and it was smooth and convenient.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Date manipulation in JavaScript</strong></p> <p>Exploring the history of <a href="https://medium.com/@vitorbritto/mastering-date-an-time-in-javascript-a4c12501aa6a">date manipulation in JavaScript</a> and its evolution over time was enlightening. I learned about various methods for date manipulation in JavaScript and compared date-fns with competing libraries like <a href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a> and <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, considering date-fns aims to improve Duration support, I explored the experimental ECMAScript <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html">Temporal proposal</a> that seeks to provide native support for Durations in JavaScript. This proposal could potentially enhance duration functions without using our library, however, polyfills like these tend to be heavy, prompting date-fns to implement a lightweight solution as an interim API with a minimal subset of the Temporal proposal.</p> <h4 id="2-reflections-on-contributing-to-date-fns">2. Reflections on contributing to date-fns<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#2-reflections-on-contributing-to-date-fns" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>date-fns has a <a href="https://date-fns.org/docs/Contributing">Contributing Guide</a> detailing how to contribute to the project.</p> <p><strong>2.1 Good: No more &quot;Move fast and break things&quot;</strong></p> <p>Having worked in fast-paced environments before, I generally embrace the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; mentality (maybe a bit too much :3 -&gt; RepoSense issues <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2164">#2164</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2184">#2184</a>). However, you do not have that &quot;freedom&quot; when working on an npm package with 20 million weekly downloads. This was a good learning experience for me as even a simple function such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">parseISODuration</code> required extensive discussions regarding design decisions, for example, whether undefined values should be preserved, what rules should be followed for parsing, etc., and all these should consider the standard proposals, the competitor libraries&#39; features, and the community&#39;s feedback.</p> <p><strong>2.2 Good: Making a difference</strong></p> <p>While many other OSS projects I contributed to involved fixing bugs or adding small features, date-fns was more about making a difference. Since date-fns is a modular library with pure functions, contributors get to work on actual features that can be used by millions of developers worldwide. This was a great motivation for me to contribute to date-fns.</p> <p><strong>2.3 Good: Targeted mentorship</strong></p> <p>I reached out to the maintainers of date-fns and they were very helpful in guiding me on how to contribute to the project. This helped me work on the project for a longer period of time and make more meaningful contributions based on the project&#39;s needs instead of randomly picking issues to work on.</p> <p><strong>2.4 To improve: Community management</strong></p> <p>date-fns has a large community and a lot of issues are opened every day. However, the 3-5 maintainers of the project do not have the bandwidth to manage all the issues. This makes it difficult for new contributors to find issues to work on. Moreover, repetitive issues are opened multiple times, leading to duplicated efforts in PRs. This is something that can be improved in date-fns.</p> <p>Since there are too many PRs opened, the maintainers have decided to only focus on those PRs that contribute towards the project&#39;s long-term goals, which is a good strategy to ensure that the project is moving in the right direction. Sometimes, contributors are not responsive to maintainers&#39; feedback and this leads to abandoned PRs. Instead of starting from scratch, I learned how to handle abandoned PRs by taking over one and completing the work.</p> <p><strong>2.5 To improve: Documentation contrasts</strong></p> <p>While date-fns has a very comprehensive documentation website, the <a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org">documentation website generator</a> did not have any contribution guidelines, because it was mainly handled by the core team. This made it difficult for me to understand how to contribute to the custom documentation website generator, and I had to reach out to the maintainers for guidance. This is understandable as the documentation site generator does not expect much community contributions, but is still something that can be improved in date-fns.</p> <h4 id="3-suggestions-for-reposense">3. Suggestions for RepoSense<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#3-suggestions-for-reposense" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>3.1 One-to-one mentorship</strong></p> <p>date-fns has a system where maintainers provide weekly advice to contributors to help them make meaningful contributions to the project. This is a great way to guide new contributors and help them understand the project better. This is something that can be adopted by RepoSense to help new contributors make contributions that align with project goals.</p> <p><strong>3.2 Automatic documentation generation</strong></p> <p>Looking at the custom documentation generator for date-fns got me thinking about whether there is a way to automatically generate documentation for RepoSense, especially for the CLI arguments and the configuration files. This would help new contributors understand the project better and also assist in maintaining up-to-date documentation. Although the work required to set up the documentation generator might be substantial, it could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the long run, particularly if well-documented.</p> <p><strong>3.3 New contributor issues</strong></p> <p>If we aim to attract more first-time contributors to NUS-OSS projects as opposed to long-term contributors, we could establish a system akin to checkstyle&#39;s approach by labelling issues as &quot;good first issue,&quot; &quot;good second issue,&quot; and so on. By doing this, RepoSense can streamline the onboarding process and foster a welcoming community for a diverse pool of contributors. This would also help in managing the influx of new contributors and ensure that they have a smooth onboarding experience.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="david-gareth-ong">DAVID GARETH ONG<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#david-gareth-ong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-recharts">Project: Recharts<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-recharts" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues">Recharts</a> is a React library that provides an easy way to write &amp; render charts in React applications.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-12">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-12" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>My first contribution was updating the <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> page of the project. Storybook is a frontend workshop that allows users to render UI components and/or pages in isolation, and is often used for interactive documentation of each component in UI libraries. Within Recharts, in addition to the standard markdown-based documentation of its components, it maintains a Storybook page that documents each component interactively, as well as providing examples of how to achieve common use-cases with the components it provides.</p> <p>In <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/4339">docs: add storybook example for line trailing icon in LineChart</a>, I added an example of how to add a custom trailing icon to a line within a line chart, which was a common usecase that required a workaround.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-11">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-11" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>The observed workflow/process of this external project has a couple of extremely important differences to our internal project (RepoSense in particular), which I feel we can learn from to improve developer experience, reduce the likelihood of regressions, and speed up turnaround time.</p> <h4 id="usage-of-git-hooks">Usage of git hooks<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#usage-of-git-hooks" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>The project has set up automatic hooks (using <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky">Husky</a>) that run before every <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/.husky/pre-commit">commit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/.husky/pre-push">push</a>. These hooks run the linter and automated tests, and prevent any user from pushing if the linter and/or tests fail. What this does is guarantee that by the time a pull request is open, there won&#39;t exist any lint or test errors. It is a very common occurence in RepoSense that a contributor will open a pull request, and only then be notified that their code has a bunch of lint errors (this is even more common in frontend PRs). The most likely reason for this is that the linter script in the frontend folder (<code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm run lint</code>) is never run during self testing, resulting in newer contributors almost always not being aware of the presence of the lint checks until the first time they open a PR and the CI runs. We can potentially save a lot of headache by implementing automatic git hooks into RepoSense, at least for linting the frontend codebase at a minimum. This would also probably speed up turnaround/development time, since there usually is quite a lot of time wasted when reviewers have to ask contributors to fix their linting errors.</p> <h4 id="snapshot-testing">Snapshot testing<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#snapshot-testing" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>The project also utilizes snapshot testing in their automated tests. They use <a href="https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html">Vitest to run snapshot tests</a>, which is a library that we&#39;re <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2000">considering</a> in RepoSense as well. Snapshot testing involves the automatic creation of snapshot files that stores the output at the time the tests were run, and compares future outputs to these refefrence values. The snapshot files are usually checked into version control, and can be examined alongside code changes. Here&#39;s an example of a <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/test/cartesian/__snapshots__/ReferenceArea.spec.tsx.snap">snapshot file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/test/cartesian/ReferenceArea.spec.tsx#L375">snapshot check</a> in the external project&#39;s codebase. This is definitely something that we can consider implementing within RepoSense, with the intention of preventing regressions.</p> <h4 id="importance-of-good-first-issues">Importance of good first issues<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#importance-of-good-first-issues" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>The project makes a great effort to properly tag &amp; maintain a list of good first issues for newer contributors, which usually consist of smaller and easier issues that don&#39;t require deep knowledge of large portions of the codebase to tackle. This was crucial in enabling my experience of contributing, and we should look to paying more attention to this in RepoSense, especially for each new batch.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="gokul-rajiv">GOKUL RAJIV<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#gokul-rajiv" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-pandoc">Project: Pandoc<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-pandoc" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Pandoc is a Haskell library and command-line tool for converting between various document formats. It is a powerful tool that can convert between many different formats, including Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, and many others. It is also extensible, allowing for the creation of custom readers and writers for new formats. Pandoc has 31.8k stars on GitHub and is used widely by individuals for personal workflows and within deployment pipelines by larger organizations.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-13">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-13" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ul><li>Fixed an issue involving Pandoc&#39;s Texinfo Writer: <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/9359">Add @var support in Texinfo Writer #8534</a> (merged)</li> <li>Fixed an issue involving Pandoc&#39;s RST Reader: <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/9744">RST reader: fix figclass and align annotations for figures</a> (merged)</li></ul> <h3 id="my-learning-record-12">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-12" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>The Haskell tooling ecosystem (GHC, Cabal, Stack, Haskell LSP, etc) makes writing Haskell quite enjoyable. In particular, Haskell features like abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and type inferencing make understanding and modifying code in a general and well-abstracted way really easy to do. The language also allows for strong editor tooling that also helps improve the developer experience. Contributing to Pandoc allowed me to get a deep look at practical Haskell in a widely adopted and loved tool—something I&#39;ve always wanted to do.</p> <p>Pandoc is also a really great and flexible tool that has taught me a great deal about software design practices. Pandoc has lofty goals of providing good document conversion from a large number of input formats to a really large number of output formats. This is done by converting to and from Pandoc&#39;s own document intermediate representation, which has a large subset of the intersection of features of the input and output formats. By being very clear about the extent and specification of the intermediate representation, it is easy for several developers to concurrently add, modify, and fix existing readers and writers by mapping the semantics of the source or target specification to those of the Pandoc intermediate representation. In general, being very clear and thorough with interfaces between software segments seems to be an important and crucial aspect of any sufficiently sophisticated system. To a first approximation, Pandoc does a really good job of picking good defaults for the output format; if users want additional customizability, they can have that by writing their own custom Lua filters.</p> <h4 id="observations-from-contribution-process">Observations from contribution process<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#observations-from-contribution-process" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>Great practices:</p> <ul><li>The maintainer, John MacFarlane (a philosophy professor at Berkeley), and other core maintainers are incredibly active. Both my PRs got attention within a day. The first PR was merged in under a day, and the second PR was merged in under an hour! Fast and active review provides contributors with quick feedback and, personally, was a very strong motivator for making more contributions. I definitely see myself tackling deeper issues over the summer.</li> <li>Great user documentation: The user documentation is really thorough and covers just about everything a user might need to get started and to get going with advanced features like Lua filters.</li> <li><code class="hljs inline no-lang">good first issue</code> tags are a great entry point to the codebase. They cover issues that can be tackled without a very deep understanding of the codebase, but that still familiarize the contributor with the workflow of dealing with an issue and adding tests.</li></ul> <p>Possible improvements:</p> <ul><li>Since not as many people contribute to Pandoc (likely due to the Haskell learning curve) outside of the core team compared to other large open source projects, there has not been much of a need for PR workflow automation. While CI&#39;s are run, more checks could be conducted with bots and other tools provided by Github actions to automate more of the review process (as is quite common with most big open source projects).</li> <li>I found developer documentation to be a little lacking (again likely due to the small number of contributors). It would have been nice to see details of things like editor set-up with the Haskell LSP, build instructions for particular pandoc applications, and a more detailed look at the codebase architecture.</li></ul> <h4 id="suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations">Suggestions for the internal project based on external project observations<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <ul><li>I think the biggest takeaway personally was the importance of active maintenance and support. A community is only as active as its maintainers, and knowing that work will be promptly reviewed is crucial for the life and longevity of the community. This is definitely something we can improve on with RepoSense. It is, however, certainly a challenge with nus-oss, given that students come and go fairly frequently and attention has to contend with school work and other activities.</li> <li>Experience with Pandoc and Haskell has convinced me that advanced-type systems and function style programming help programmers write safer and more resilient software. Unfortunately, Java&#39;s type system (even with newer versions) is not nearly as powerful as Haskell&#39;s and limits how far we can take these ideas. Nevertheless, we can make some progress with making Reposense easier to reason about with refactors involving <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/2144">immutability and optional monads</a>.</li></ul></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="marcus-tang-xin-kye">MARCUS TANG XIN KYE<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#marcus-tang-xin-kye" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-supabase">Project: Supabase<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-supabase" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="overview">Overview<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#overview" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a> is a prominent open-source alternative to Firebase, aiming to replicate Firebase&#39;s features using enterprise-grade open-source tools.

They may continue to use that version for their projects even when much newer Python versions are released. Thus, the Python team needs to continue to support older versions (up to a limit) by making sure that bug fixes, and security patches are also made to the supported older Python versions.</p> <p>Each version is maintained on their own respective Git branch, but all changes are initially made by submitting a PR to the main branch. The PRs are given labels like <code class="hljs inline no-lang">needs backport to 3.12</code> which indicate whether the PR needs to be backported to a specific Git branch for a Python version. When a PR is merged into the main branch, a bot (<a href="https://github.com/apps/miss-islington-app">miss-islington-app</a>) backports it to older Python branches according to the labels. It does this by submitting the same PR to the Git branches of the relevant Python versions. A member of the Python project team can then merge the PR into the Git branches of the relevant Python versions.</p> <p>In TEAMMATES, we may often have multiple feature branches in addition to the main branch. Fixes may be made to the main branch that are also required on the feature branches. In TEAMMATES, we often integrate these fixes into the feature branches by manually rebasing the feature branch onto the last commit on the main branch or merging the main branch into the feature branch. In other words, unlike in the Python project where changes in the main branch are almost automatically integrated into the other branches, in TEAMMATES, these changes to the main branch are manually integrated into other branches.</p> <h4 id="suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations-2">Suggestions for the internal project based on external project observations<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <h5 id="changelog-with-highlights">Changelog with highlights<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#changelog-with-highlights" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h5> <p>Instead of displaying all the changes equally, it may be better to highlight some of them, as they be more significant to more users.

Maybe a bot can do this for us. A problem I can foresee with this is if there are merge conflicts. However, it is possible to make a PR for merging branches. The merge conflicts may be resolved manually in the branch created for the PR. While this reintroduces some manual work, the merge conflicts should not occur all the time. If this automation is possible, with some of the changes in the main branch being integrated into the feature branches automatically, this may reduce some of the load on the developers.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="kevin-foong-wei-tong">KEVIN FOONG WEI TONG<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#kevin-foong-wei-tong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-scribe-ios">Project: Scribe iOS<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-scribe-ios" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS">Scribe-iOS</a> is a pack of iOS keyboards for language learners.

They are transparent about progress, and reach out to both users and contributers to encourage usage and contributions. Because Litestar is an ASGI framework that manages the majority of an application, it requires a large amount of effort and trust by users into the project.</p> <p>For example, they regularly post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/search/?q=litestar&amp;">updates on the Python subreddit</a> on major milestone and releases. Furthermore, they hold regular office hours live, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LitestarOrg">recordings are also posted on YouTube</a>. Furthermore, they maintain a very large pool of <a href="https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22">&quot;Good First Issues&quot;</a> for contributers to start on.

They&#39;ve since achieved this, and their project has been stronger than ever. This is in contrast to FastAPI, which infamously has only a <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/4263">single maintainer</a>, who refuses to take on more maintainers or accept PRs.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="neo-wei-qing">NEO WEI QING<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#neo-wei-qing" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-ancientbeast">Project: AncientBeast<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-ancientbeast" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast">AncientBeast</a> is a turn-based strategy game that has been around for 13 years, with a small but active developer base and player community. It is played directly on the browser and supports various game modes including online multiplayer. The current version being worked on is v0.5.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-22">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-22" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>I have mainly worked on the improvement of visuals, adding some information on the hexagon grid upon some user action.</p> <p>My <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues/2536">first issue</a> was to show a &#39;Skip turn&#39; icon when the user hovers over an active unit. To solve this issue (PR <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/pull/2558">here</a>), I added some assets to the assets loaded as well as an additional hint type. Then, I added the &#39;Skip turn&#39; icon if the new hint type was called.</p> <p>My <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues/2537">second issue</a> was to show the selected ability above the hovered hexagon when targeting the ability. This issue presented a different challenge, since the hint types above are only used for units. To solve this issue (PR <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/pull/2567">here</a> and still ongoing), I had to add the unit abilities to the assets, and then add an &#39;ability&#39; class to the hovered hex&#39;s overlay visual state, removing the class as necessary. Then, I checked if the &#39;ability&#39; class was present, got the appropriate ability asset, and set it to be shown above the hexagon. Unfortunately, due to some complications and a decision to focus more on TEAMMATES work, I have been unable to resolve some of the problems with the PR. I plan to complete it during the exam weeks.</p> <p>Afterwards, I plan to take on this <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues/2539">third issue</a> after the PR above is merged, as it is makes use of the changes made in the above 2 PRs.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-21">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-21" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>AncientBeast makes use of <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> as its game engine (which is also <a href="https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/tree/v3.80.1">open source</a>). Having had not much experience with game development, I found using Phaser quite challenging, and had to rely a lot on community help. I mainly learnt about how to manipulate GameObjects, such as Sprites, in Phaser as well as how they are animated and rendered.</p> <p>Another thing I learnt about was testing a game&#39;s UI using Jest. The approach AncientBeast took relied mostly on getting game objects at certain <code class="hljs inline no-lang">x</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang">y</code> positions, as well as checking what existed at certain coordinates to ensure that actions were correctly handled. Some of the difficulties faced were in trying not to have tests depend too much on implementation (e.g. of Creatures in the game), and so tests had to be a bit more general.</p> <p>More broadly, I learnt about game development in general. There is a lot more attention paid to anything that the user might try to do, including just hovering over something. I think this level of detail to user actions (and how it can be handled neatly in the codebase) is quite unique to game development.</p> <h3 id="observations-from-ancientbeast">Observations from AncientBeast<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#observations-from-ancientbeast" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Unfortunately, I think AncientBeast&#39;s code is quite messy. The files are long, variables are sometimes inappropriately named (e.g. some are just named <code class="hljs inline no-lang">o</code>), and basically a lot of functionality is packed together in one place, reducing readability. There are deprecated calls as well, which I think should be fixed together with the deprecation. Furthermore, there is a lack of developer documentation, which further poses a challenge to new contributors. For example, I think I would have greatly benefitted from some flows of standard actions, or generally how classes interact with each other. Better documentation might also lead to better structuring of code, which AncientBeast needs. Another point of improvement would be type safety, since I found that quite a few variables are just typed as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">any</code>.</p> <p>That being said, I think AncientBeast does well in contributor management. Once someone expresses an interest in an issue, they will be assigned it and given a soft deadline, usually of 2 weeks. If they cannot complete it and/or are unresponsive, then the issue will usually be assigned to someone else, or just left without an assignee, indicating that it is available. I think we could benefit from implementing a similar approach, else our issues get inundated with &quot;is this issue still available?&quot; comments and waiting for people to say whether or not they are still working on it. The soft deadline also helps to push progress along.</p> <p>Another thing we could adopt is having a standardised code format. I&#39;ve noticed many discrepancies in coding style throughout our codebase, and I think having a standardised coding style (with non-controversial rules) would make our code neater and in some cases more readable.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="ong-jun-heng-cedric">ONG JUN HENG, CEDRIC<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#ong-jun-heng-cedric" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-mattermost">Project: Mattermost<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-mattermost" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><a href="https://mattermost.com">Mattermost</a> is an open-source alternative to slack and mircosoft teams, used by notable companies such as Samsung, NASA, DuckDuckGo.

To solve this, I edited the styling of the button, changing its opacity for when its disabled.
I then replicated the issue locally to add a screenshot to my PR.</p> <p>The second was removal of a feature flag: <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/7769">link</a>, to enable timezone support permanently in the application.
To tackle this issue, I had to look at every location where there the feature flag was used in the codebase. When removing the flag, I had to make sure that the logic was correct, behaving as if the feature flag was <code class="hljs inline no-lang">true</code> and that irrelevant code was removed.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-22">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-22" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="react-native">React Native<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#react-native" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>The technology used in Mattermost&#39;s mobile application is React Native.

This makes it easier for potential contributors to select issues based on their own confidence level. In TEAMMATES, we only have <code class="hljs inline no-lang">good first issue</code> as any indicator of difficulty level, but given that most difficult issues are handled by the internal team, there is unlikely a need for difficulty level. For technology required, TEAMMATES also does not have a label, but it should be quite clear when reading the issue if it requires Backend or Frontend. TEAMMATES also has a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">a-UIX</code> tag that is meant for UIUX related issues, which is very often used to tag Frontend issues.</li> <li>Mattermost also has their own deployed instance of itself, where contributors can ask questions.
